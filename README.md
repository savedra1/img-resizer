# A simple image resizing CLI - Package deployemnt test

### About
Just a test to see how distributing Python packages via Github would work. Feel free to use this if you think it would be useful though, but you're probably better off with [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick).

### Comands
`img-resizer $IMG$` Saves a new, resized image of the specified image path to the CWD, using the default size of 512x512px.
